\begin{itemize}
  \item Explored and visualized e-commerce data using Plotly, to view Monthly Revenue, Monthly Revenue Growth Rate, Monthly Active Customers, Monthly Order Count, Average Revenue per Order, New Customer Ratio, Monthly Retention Rate, Cohort Based Retention Rate
  \item Created segments for customer data based on RFM (Recency - Frequency - Monetary Value) and calculated recency, frequency, and monetary values by K-means cluster
  \item Calculated lifetime values of customers, converted categorical columns to numerical columns by dummy data, created cluster columns of customers based on the lifetime values, and used XGBoost to predict the customer classification with 90\% precision
  \item Predicted churn rates using logistic regression \& XGBoost, and identified the most important feature (Total Charges and Monthly Charges) 
  \item Predicted Next Purchase Day by XGBoost, performed cross validation by logistic regression, GaussianNB, Random Forest, SVC, Decision Tree, K-Neighbor Classifier, and optimized model using hyper parameter tuning 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\textit{Movie Recommendation System: }}
