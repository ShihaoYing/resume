## Self introduction 

Hi I'm Shihao. As you can see on my resume, I've achieved my two master degree of Finance and Information Technology Management from UT Dallas in 2018. I also did an internship for a legal-tech company, AILaw, in the college. After that, I joined Zendure, a premium power bank brand, in Silicon valley and worked as the Operations Analyst for two years. I joined Weee, the largest Asian and Hispanic online grocery store as Supply Chain Analyst. I'm working with category manager, demand planner, and operation team for frozen seafood category in the West Coast. While keeping the healthy inventory level for all West Coast site and monitor the revenue weekly, I also joined some projects to help the team, such as optimize our day-to-day PO Tool for the whole supply chain team. 
I'm someone with strong interest in problem solving through financial modeling and data analysis skills. All my experience are in high-growth startup. I really have the passion and enjoy the environment in a fast-pace company. I found this opportunity from David. I'm appreciated this opportunity to talk with you today. That's what brings me here today.
