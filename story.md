Hi I'm Shihao. As you can see on my resume, I've achieved my two master degree of Finance and Information Technology Management from UT Dallas in 2018. I also did an internship for a legal-tech company, AILaw, in the college.

I worked with different departments for serval projects, including to set up our internal ERP system, optimize international shipping path and cost.
