Amazon Leadership Principle

[toc]


# 1. Are right, a lot
> Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.

* Use sound business judgment to make the right decisions quickly and achieve results, even in the absence of complete data?
* Question whether decision are being made in the Company's and customer's best interest and change course when they are not?
* Recognize that your idea may not be as good as someone else's and get on board with the best idea?

***

# 2. Bias for action
> Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk taking 

* Quickly identify if you need more info before taking action request that info and move forward?
* Be ready, willing and able to roll up sleeves and assist with customer facing tasks when needed?
* Ask for help when needed in a timely manner?
* Respond promptly to requests for information?
* Follow up and deliver as promised?
* Make sure you create an "action item list" (identify owner and target dates)?

***

# 3. Customer Obsession
> Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.

* Know your customer's needs and wants?
* Anticipate your customers' needs?
* Honestly pursue customer feedback, not just solicit for compliments?
* "WOW" your customers?
* Know what would be better than what your customer is even imagining?
* Ask, "Is what I'm working on helping my customer?"
* Remove non-value steps?
* Listen for what your customer wants, before/instead of telling them what they need?

***

# 4. Deliver results
> Leaders focus on the key inputs for their business and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion. Despite setbacks, they rise to the occasion and never settle.

* Continually reinforce to yourself and the team who the customer is in order to execute and deliver the right results?
* Focus on the most important tasks, while adapting as needed to achieve results?
* Persevere through setbacks and overcome obstacles to deliver outstanding results?

***

# 5. Dive Deep
> Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, audit frequently, and are skeptical when metrics and anecdote differ. No task is beneath them.

* Not pass the buck on unwanted tasks, demonstrate hustle and a 'do what it takes' attitude to get things done, even if that means being hands-on?
* Have a firm grasp of the details of your work in order to deeply discuss it?
* Frequently "audit" your work by checking accuracy, facts, and assumptions?

***

# 6. Earn Trust
> Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.

* Earn the trust and respect of the team and build positive working relationships by consistently making good decisions, keeping commitments, treating others and their ideas with respect, and adhering to high ethical standards?
* Do what you say you will do or appropriately reset expectations?
* Honor commitments made to other teams even if your own goals are in jeopardy?

***

# 7. Frugality
> Accomplish more with less. Constraints breed resourcefulness, self-sufficiency, and invention. There are no extra points for growing headcount, budget size, or fixed expense.

* Ask, "Does this spend make a positive impact for the customer?
* Creatively spend money and share your resources?
* Seek out "no-cost" alternative prior to spending?

***

# 8. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
> Leaders are obligated to respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree, even when doing so is uncomfortable or exhausting. Leaders have conviction and are tenacious. They do not compromise for the sake of social cohesion. Once a decision is determined, they commit wholly.

* Question rigorously, challenge assumptions and escalate issues up and across the "food chain" when you're not satisfied, even if unpopular?
* Stand up for what you believe is in the best interest of the company and our customers?
* Get on board with decision that have been made, even through you may not have originally agreed?

***

# 9. Hire and Develop the Best
> Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.

* Take the interviewing process seriously by understanding the job and focusing on the hiring people who we can learn from and who will raise the high performance bar?
* Drive your own development and learning by actively discussing career goals, strengths and areas for development and pursuing activities that support your growth?
* Invest in the growth of others by taking ownership to mentor and guide them when you have expertise in a particular area?

***

# 10. Insist on the Highest Standards
> Leaders have relentlessly high standards — many people may think these standards are unreasonably high. Leaders are continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high quality products, services, and processes. Leaders ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

* Ensure the quality bar remains high by delivering high quality work, and demanding it of other's work?
* Continually self-critique your work to make sure the quality is the best it can be?
* Accept and seek out coaching and feedback from your manager and others about improving the quality of your work?

***

# 11. Invent and Simplify
> Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find ways to simplify. They are externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here." As we do new things, we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.



# 12. Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious about new possibilities and act to explore them.


# 13. Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job."


# 14. Think Big
Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.
